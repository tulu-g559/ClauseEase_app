ABSTRACT Legal contracts are often filled with complex, jargon-heavy language that is difficult for non- lawyers to comprehend. This complexity can lead to misunderstandings, delays, and legal risks. ClauseEase aims to address this challenge by developing an AI-powered system that automatically extracts, analyzes, classifies, and simplifies legal contract clauses without losing their legal intent. Using natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning (ML), ClauseEase converts complex contract language into plain English while retaining accuracy and context. The system is designed to assist small businesses, clients, and legal professionals in understanding contractual terms more easily. 2. INTRODUCTION Contracts are essential legal instruments but are often written in complicated and technical language that can be overwhelming to ordinary readers. Existing tools typically paraphrase content without maintaining legal precision. ClauseEase bridges this gap by providing a modular, automated system for simplifying and explaining legal contracts. The project leverages AI technologies like Legal-BERT, spaCy, and transformers to identify clauses, detect legal terms, and generate simplified versions of each clause. This ensures accessibility and transparency while preserving legal integrity. The overall system has been divided into multiple modules, each performing a distinct function in the processing pipeline. 3. MODULES IMPLEMENTED .1",

From text extraction to clause classification and simplification, each module plays a crucial role in transforming dense legal content into readable, structured, and accurate text. The project demonstrates how AI and NLP can bridge the gap between legal complexity and human comprehension, ultimately empowering users to interpret contracts confidently without requiring legal expertise. Future improvements can include adding more clause categories, fine-tuning simplification models, and enhancing glossary-based contextual linking for better interpretability.",
