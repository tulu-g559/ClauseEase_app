This electronic document is a \"live\" template. The various components of your paper [title, text, headings, etc.] are already defined, as illustrated by the portions given in this document. The abstract is limited to 150 words and cannot contain equations, figures, tables, or references. It should concisely state what was done, how it was done, principal results, and their significance. Index Terms--The author shall provide up to 5 keywords (in alphabetical order) to help identify the major topics of the paper. The thesaurus of IEEE indexing keywords is posted at https://www.ieee.org/publications/services/thesaurus-access- page.html. I. INTRODUCTION (HEADING 1) This template provides authors with most of the formatting specifications needed for preparing electronic versions of PES Conference papers. All standard paper components have been specified for three reasons: (1) ease of use when formatting individual papers, (2) automatic compliance to electronic requirements that facilitate the concurrent or later production of electronic products, and (3) conformity of style throughout a conference's proceedings. Margins, column widths, line spacing, and type styles are built-in; examples of the type styles are provided throughout this document and are identified in italic type, within parentheses, following the example. Some components, such as multi-leveled equations, graphics, and tables are not prescribed, although the various table text styles are provided. The formatter will need to create these components, incorporating the applicable criteria that follow. II. EASE OF USE A. Template (Heading 2) This template has been tailored for output on US letter- sized paper. B. Maintaining the Integrity of the Specifications The template is used to format your paper and style the text. All margins, column widths, line spaces, and text fonts are prescribed; please do not alter them. You may note peculiarities. For example, the heading margin in this template measures proportionately more than is customary. This measurement and others are deliberate, using specifications that anticipate your paper as one part of the entire proceedings, and not as an independent document. Please do not revise any of the current designations. III. CONFERENCE PAPER PREPARATION Conference papers are limited to a maximum of five pages. Please use automatic hyphenation and check your spelling. Additionally, be sure your sentences are complete and that there is continuity within your paragraphs. Check the numbering of your graphics (figures and tables) and make sure that all appropriate references are included. Please take note of the following items when proofreading spelling and grammar: A. Abbreviations and Acronyms Define abbreviations and acronyms the first time they are used in the text, even after they have been defined in the abstract. Abbreviations such as IEEE, SI, ac, dc, and rms do not have to be defined. Do not use abbreviations in the title or section headings unless they are unavoidable. B. Units  Metric units are preferred for use in IEEE publications in light of their global readership and the inherent convenience of these units in many fields. In particular, the use of the International System of Units (Systeme Internationale d'Unites or SI Units) is advocated. This system includes a subsystem of units based on the meter, kilogram, second, and ampere (MKSA). U.S. Customary units, or British units, may be used as secondary units (in parentheses). An Identify applicable sponsor/s here. (sponsors) exception is when U.S. Customary units are used as identifiers in trade, such as 3.5-inch disk drive.  Avoid combining SI and U.S. Customary units, such as current in amperes and magnetic field in oersteds. This often leads to confusion because equations do not balance dimensionally. If you must use mixed units, clearly state the units for each quantity that you use in an equation.  Do not mix complete spellings and abbreviations of units: \"Wb/m2\" or \"webers per square meter\", not \"webers/m2\". Spell out units when they appear in text: \". . . a few henries\", not \". . . a few H\".  Use a zero before decimal points: \"0.25\", not \".25\". Use \"cm3\", not \"cc\". (bullet list) C. Equations The equations are an exception to the prescribed specifications of this template. You will need to determine whether or not your equation should be typed using either the Times New Roman or the Symbol font (please no other font). To create multileveled equations, it may be necessary to treat the equation as a graphic and insert it into the text after your paper is styled. Use of the Microsoft Equation Editor or the MathType commercial add-on for MS Word for math objects in your paper is permissible (Insert | Equation or MathType Equation). \"Float over text\" should not be selected. Number equations consecutively. Equation numbers, within parentheses, are to position flush right, as in (1), using a right tab stop. To make your equations more compact, you may use the solidus ( / ), the exp function, or appropriate exponents. Italicize Roman symbols for quantities and variables, but not Greek symbols. Use a long dash, as shown in (1), rather than a hyphen for a minus sign. Punctuate equations with commas or periods when they are part of a sentence, as in    Note that the equation above is centered using a center tab stop. Be sure that the symbols in your equation have been defined before or immediately following the equation. Use \"(1)\", not \"Eq. (1)\" or \"equation (1)\", except at the beginning of a sentence: \"Equation (1) is . . .\" D. Footnotes Number footnotes separately in superscripts. Place the actual footnote at the bottom of the column in which it was cited. Do not put footnotes in the reference list. Use letters for table footnotes. E. Some Common Mistakes  The word \"data\" is plural, not singular.  The subscript for the permeability of vacuum 0, and other common scientific constants, is zero with subscript formatting, not a lowercase letter \"o\".  In American English, commas, semi-/colons, periods, question and exclamation marks are located within quotation marks only when a complete thought or name is cited, such as a title or full quotation. When quotation marks are used, instead of a bold or italic typeface, to highlight a word or phrase, punctuation should appear outside of the quotation marks. A parenthetical phrase or statement at the end of a sentence is punctuated outside of the closing parenthesis (like this). (A parenthetical sentence is punctuated within the parentheses.)  A graph within a graph is an \"inset\", not an \"insert\". The word alternatively is preferred to the word \"alternately\" (unless you really mean something that alternates).  Do not use the word \"essentially\" to mean \"approximately\" or \"effectively\".  In your paper title, if the words \"that uses\" can accurately replace the word \"using\", capitalize the \"u\"; if not, keep using lower-cased.  Be aware of the different meanings of the homophones \"affect\" and \"effect\", \"complement\" and \"compliment\", \"discreet\" and \"discrete\", \"principal\" and \"principle\".  Do not confuse \"imply\" and \"infer\".  The prefix \"non\" is not a word; it should be joined to the word it modifies, usually without a hyphen.  There is no period after the \"et\" in the Latin abbreviation \"et al.\".  The abbreviation \"i.e.\" means \"that is\", and the abbreviation \"e.g.\" means \"for example\". IV. USING THE TEMPLATE This document should be used as a template for preparing your Conference paper. You may type over sections of the document, cut and paste into it, and/or use markup styles. Duplicate the template file by using the Save As command, and use the naming convention prescribed by your conference for the name of your paper. A. Authors and Affiliations The template is designed so that author affiliations are not repeated each time for multiple authors of the same affiliation. Please keep your affiliations as succinct as possible (for example, do not differentiate among departments of the same organization). This template was designed for two affiliations. 1) For author/s of only one affiliation (Heading 3): To change the default, adjust the template as follows. a) Selection (Heading 4): Highlight all author and affiliation lines. b) Change number of columns: Select the Columns icon from the MS Word Standard toolbar and then select \"1 Column\" from the selection palette. We suggest that you use a text box to insert a graphic (which is ideally a 300 dpi TIFF or EPS file, with all fonts embedded) because, in an MSW document, this method is somewhat more stable than directly inserting a picture. To have non-visible rules on your frame, use the MSWord \"Format\" pull-down menu, select Text Box > Colors and Lines to choose No Fill and No Line. c) Deletion: Delete the author and affiliation lines for the second affiliation. 2) For author/s of more than two affiliations: To change the default, adjust the template as follows. a) Selection: Highlight all author and affiliation lines. b) Change number of columns: Select the \"Columns\" icon from the MS Word Standard toolbar and then select the number of columns desired from the selection palette. c) Highlight author and affiliation lines of affiliation 1 and copy this selection. d) Formatting: Insert one hard return immediately after the last character of the last affiliation line. Then paste down the copy of affiliation 1. Repeat as necessary for each additional affiliation. e) Reassign number of columns: Place your cursor to the right of the last character of the last affiliation line of an even numbered affiliation (e.g., if there are five affiliations, place your cursor at end of fourth affiliation). Drag the cursor up to highlight all of the above author and affiliation lines. Go to Column icon and select \"2 Columns\". If you have an odd number of affiliations, the final affiliation will be centered on the page; all previous will be in two columns. B. Identify the Headings Headings are organizational devices that guide the reader through your paper. There are two types: component headings and text headings. Component headings identify the different components of your paper and are not topically subordinate to each other. Examples include ACKNOWLEDGMENTS and REFERENCES and, for these, the correct style to use is \"Heading 5\". Use \"figure caption\" for your Figure captions, and \"table heading\" for your table title. Run-in headings, such as \"Abstract\", will require you to apply a style (in this case, italic) in addition to the style provided by the drop down menu to differentiate the heading from the text. Text headings organize the topics on a relational, hierarchical basis. For example, the paper title is the primary text heading because all subsequent material relates and elaborates on this one topic. If there are two or more sub- topics, the next level heading (uppercase Roman numerals) should be used and, conversely, if there are not at least two sub-topics, then no subheadings should be introduced. Styles named \"Heading 1\", \"Heading 2\", \"Heading 3\", and \"Heading 4\" are prescribed. C. Figures and Tables 1) Positioning Figures and Tables: Large figures and tables may span across both columns. Figure captions should be below the figures; table headings should appear above the tables. Insert figures and tables after they are cited in the text as close to the citation as possible. Use the abbreviation \"Fig. 1\", even at the beginning of a sentence. TABLE I. TABLE TYPE STYLES a. Example of a Table footnote. (Table footnote) Figure Labels: Use 8 point Times New Roman for Figure labels. Use words rather than symbols or abbreviations when writing Figure axis labels to avoid confusing the reader. As an example, write the quantity \"Magnetization\", or \"Magnetization, M\", not just \"M\". If including units in the label, present them within parentheses. Do not label axes only with units. In the example, write \"Magnetization (A/m)\" or \"Magnetization {A[m(1)]}\", not just \"A/m\". Do not label axes with a ratio of quantities and units. For example, write \"Temperature (K)\", not \"Temperature/K\". Figures and tables should be numbered consecutively. Use Arabic numerals for figures and Roman numerals for tables. Figure 1. Example of a figure caption. (figure caption) ACKNOWLEDGMENT (HEADING 5) The preferred spelling of the word \"acknowledgment\" in America is without an \"e\" after the \"g\". Avoid the stilted expression, \"One of us (R. B. G.) thanks . . .\" Instead, try \"R. B. G. thanks\". Put sponsor acknowledgments in the unnumbered footnote on the first page. The following is an example of an acknowledgment. The authors gratefully acknowledge the contributions of T. Edison, G. Westinghouse, N. Tesla, A. Volta and A. Ampere to the electric power industry. REFERENCES References are important to the reader; therefore, each citation must be complete and correct. There is no editorial check on references; therefore, an incomplete or wrong reference will be published unless caught by a reviewer and will detract from the authority and value of the paper. References should be readily available publications. List only one reference per reference number. If a reference is available from two sources, each should be listed as a separate reference. The template will number citations consecutively within brackets [1]. The sentence punctuation follows the bracket [2]. Table Heading Table Column Heading Table column subheading Subheading Subheading copy More table copya Multiple references [3], [4] are each numbered with separate brackets [4]-[6]. Refer simply to the reference number, as in [7]—do not use \"Ref. [7]\" or \"reference [7]\" except at the beginning of a sentence: \"Reference [7] was the first . . .\" Unless there are six authors or more give all authors' names; do not use \"et al.\". Papers that have not been published, even if they have been submitted for publication, should be cited as \"unpublished\" [8]-[10]. Capitalize only the first word in a paper title, except for proper nouns and element symbols. For papers published in translation journals, please give the English citation first, followed by the original foreign-language citation [11]. Papers that have been accepted for publication, but not yet published, should be cited as \"in press\" [12]. Samples of the correct formats for various types of references are given below [1]-[16].

This electronic document is a \"live\" template. The various components of your paper [title, text, headings, etc.] The various components of your paper [title, text, headings, etc.] Les définitions sont déjà définies, telles qu'illustrées dans les parties données dans le présent document. The abstract is limited to 150 words and cannot contain equations, figures, tables, or references. Il devrait préciser concisely ce qui a été fait, comment il a été fait, les principaux résultats, et leur importance. Index Terms--The author shall provide up to 5 keywords (in alphabetical order) to help identify the major topics of the paper. Thesaurus of IEEE indexing keywords is posted at https://www.ieee.org/publications/services/thesaurus-access- page.html. I. INTRODUCTION (HEADING 1) This template provides authors with the most of the formatting specifications needed for preparing electronic versions of PES Conference papers. components have been specified for three reasons: (1) ease of use when formatting individual papers, (2) automatic compliance to electronic requirements that facilitate the concurrent or later production of electronic products, and (3) conformity of style throughout a conference proceedings. ; examples of the type styles are provided throughout this document; examples of the type styles are provided throughout this document and are identified in italic type, within parentheses, following the example. Einige Komponenten, wie multi-leveled equations, graphics, and tables are not prescribed, although the various table text styles are provided. Der Formatter wird zwing sein, diese Komponenten zu erstellen, indem er die entsprechenden Kriterien enthält. II. Template (Head 2) This template has been tailored for output on US letter size paper. B. Maintenir l’intégrité des Specifications Le template est utilisé pour formater votre papier et styler le texte. , column widths, line spaces, and text fonts are prescribed; please do not alter them. Vous pouvez remarquer certaines peculiarities.        Cette mesure et d’autres sont deliberates, en utilisant des spécifications qui anticipent votre paper comme une partie de l’ensemble des procédures, et non comme un document indépendant. Bitte revidieren Sie keine der aktuellen Bezeichnungen. III III.                                     . Bitte benutzen Sie automatisch hyphenation und überprüfen Sie Ihre spelling. De plus, be sure your sentences are complete and that there is continuity within your paragraphs. Check the numbering of your graphics (figures and tables) and make sure that all appropriate references are included. : A. Abbreviations and Acronyms Define abbreviations and acronyms the first time they are used in the text, even after they have been defined in the abstract. Die Abkürzungen wie IEEE, SI, ac, dc, and rms müssen nicht definiert werden. Use abbreviations in the title or section headings unless they are inevitable. B. Units  Metric units are preferred for use in IEEE publications in light of their global readership and the inherent convenience of these units in many fields. In particular, the use of the International System of Units (Systeme Internationale d'Unites or SI Units) is advocated. a subsystem of units based on the meter, kilogram, second, and ampere (MKSA). US Les unités coutumières, ou britanniques, peuvent être utilisées comme secondaires (entre parenthèses). An Identify applicable sponsor/s here. (sponsors) exception is when U.S. trade, such as 3.5-inch disk drive.  Avoid combining SI and U.S. Unités coutumières, telles que courant in amperes et magnetic field in oersteds. Dies führt oft zu Verwirrung, weil die Gleichungen nicht dimensional ausgeglichen sind. Indizieren Sie die units for each quantity you use in a equation.  Do not mix complete spellings and abbreviations of units: \"Wb/m2\" or \"webers per square meter\", not \"webers/m2\". Spell out units when they appear in text: \".   Einige Heries\", nicht \".   \" \"  Use a zero before decimal points: \"0.25\", not \".25\". Verwenden Sie \"cm3\", verwenden Sie \"cm3\", und nicht \"cc\". (bullet list) C. Equations The equations are an exception to the prescribed specifications of this template. the Times New Roman or the Symbol font (please no other font). multileveled equations, it may be necessary to treat the equation as a graphic and insert it into the text after your paper is styled. to use the Microsoft Equation Editor or the MathType commercial add-on for MS Word for math objects in your paper is permissible (Insert | Equation or MathType Equation). \"Float over text\" sollte nicht ausgewählt werden. . , as in (1), using a right tab stop. more compact, you may use the solidus ( / ), the exp function, or appropriate exponents. Italicize Roman symbols for quantities and variables, but not Greek symbols. Use a long dash, as shown in (1), rather than a hyphen for a minus sign.   Note that the equation above is centered using a center tab stop. Be sure that the symbols in your equation have been defined before or immediately following the equation. Use \"(1)\", not \"Eq. or \"equation (1)\", except at the beginning of a sentence  \" Footnotes Number footnotes separately in superscripts. Place the actual footnote at the bottom of the column in which it was cited. Ne mettez pas de footnotes dans la liste de référence. Use letters for table footnotes. E. Some Common Mistakes  The word \"data\" is plural, not singular.  The subscript for the permeability of vacuum 0, and other common scientific constants, is zero with subscript formatting, not a lowercase letter \"o\".  In American English, commas, semi-/colons, periods, question marks, exclamation marks are located within quotation marks only when a complete thought or name is cited, such as a title or full quotation. Lorsque quotation marks are used, instead of bold or italic typeface, to highlight a word or phrase, punctuation should appear outside of the quotation marks. Eine parenthetische Formulierung oder Aussage am Ende eines Satzes ist punctuiert außerhalb der Parenthesis (wie diese). (Un parenthetical sentence is punctuated within the parentheses.)  Ein graph innerhalb eines graphs ist ein \"inset\", nicht ein \"insert\". The word alternatively is preferred to the word \"alternately\" (unless you really mean something that alternates).  Do not use the word \"essentially\" to mean \"approximately\" or \"effectively\".  In your paper title, if the words \"that uses\" can accurately replace the word \"using\", capitalize the \"u\"; if not, keep using lower-cased. Be aware of the different meanings of the homophones \"affect\" and \"effect\", \"complement\" and \"compliment\", \"discrete\", \"discrete\", \"principal\" and \"principle\".  Ne confundieren Sie nicht \"imply\" und \"infer\".  The prefix \"non\" is not a word; it should be joined to the word it modifies, usually without a hyphen.  There is no period after the \"et\" in the Latin abbreviation \"et al.  The abbreviation \" \" Das bedeutet \"that is\", und die Abkreation \"e.g. Das bedeutet \"beispielspiel\". IV. This document should be used as a template for preparing your Conference paper. Vous pouv type over sections of the document, cut and paste into it, and/or use markup styles. Duplicate the template file by using the Save As command, and use the naming convention prescribed by your conference for the name of your paper. A. Autors and affiliations The template is designed so that author affiliations are not repeated each time for multiple authors of the same affiliation. Bitte halten Sie Ihre affiliations so succinct wie möglich (beispielsweise, unterscheiden Sie nicht zwischen den einzelnen Abteilungen derselben Organisation). This template was designed for two affiliations. 1) For author/s of only one affiliation (Heading 3): To change the default, adjust the template as follows. a) Selection (Heading 4): Highlight all author and affiliation lines. b) Change number of columns: Select the Columns icon from the MS Word Standard toolbar and then select \"1 Column\" from the selection palette. text box to insert a graphic (which is ideally a 300 dpi TIFF or EPS file, with all fonts embedded) because in an MSW document, this method is somewhat more stable than directly inserting a picture. Pour avoir des règles non-visibles sur votre frame, use the MSWord \"Format\" pull-down menu, select Text Box > Colors and Lines to choose No Fill and No Line. c) Deletion: Delete the author and affiliation lines for the second affiliation. 2) For author/s of more than two affiliations: To change the default, adjust the template as follows. 2) For author/s of more than two affiliations: To change the default, adjust the template as follows. a) Selection: Highlight all author and affiliation lines. b) Change number of columns: Select the \"Columns\" icon from the MS Word Standard toolbar and then select the number of columns desired from the selection palette. c) Highlight author and affiliation lines of affiliation 1 and copy this selection. d) Formatting: Insert one hard return immediately after the last character of the last affiliation line. paste paste down the copy of affiliation 1. Repeat as necessary for each additional affiliation. e) Reassign number of columns: Place your cursor to the right of the last character of the last affiliation line of an even numbered affiliation line (e.g., if there are five affiliations, place your cursor at end of fourth affiliation). Drag Drag Drag the cursor up to highlight all of the above author and affiliation lines. Go to Column icon and select \"2 Columns\". , the final affiliation will be centered on the page; all previous will be in two columns. B. Identify the Headings Identify the Headings Identify the Headings Identify the Headings Identify the Headings Identify the Headings The Headings are organizational devices that guide the reader through your paper. Es gibt zwei Typen: component headings and text headings.     Beispiele: ACKNOWLEDGMENTS and REFERENCES, and, for these, the correct style to use is \"Heading 5\". Use \"figure caption\" for your Figure captions, and \"table heading\" for your table title. \"Abstract\" will require you to apply a style (in this case, italic) in addition to the style provided by the drop down menu to differentiate the heading from the text. the topics on a relational, hierarchical basis. , the paper title is the primary text heading because all subsequent material relates and elaborates on this one topic. the next level heading (uppercase Roman numerals) should be used and, conversely, if there are not at least two sub-topics, then no subheadings should be introduced. Es werden Styles namens \"Heading 1\", \"Heading 2\", \"Heading 3\" und \"Heading 4\" angegeben. Figures and Tables 1) Positioning Figures and Tables: Large figures and tables may span across both columns. the figures; table headings should appear above the tables. Insérer les figures et tableaux après les citations dans le texte le plus près possible de la citation. Use the abbreviation \"Fig. 1\", même au début d'une sentence. TABLEABLE I. TYPE TYPE TABLE Example Example of a table footnote. Figure Labels: Use 8 point Times New Roman for Figure labels. Use words rather than symbols or abbreviations when writing Figure axis labels to avoid confusing the reader.  titre d'exemple, écrivez la quantité \"Magnetization\", ou \"Magnetization, M\", et non seulement \"M\". Si l'inclusion d'unités dans l'étiquette est faite, présentez-les entre parenthèses. Ne pas étiqueter les axes uniquement avec unités. In this example, write \"Magnetization (A/m)\" or \"Magnetization A[m(1)]\", not just \"A/m\". axes with a ratio of quantities and units. Schreiben Sie zum Beispiel \"Temperature (K)\" und nicht \"Temperature/K\". Les figures et tableaux doivent être numérotés consécutivement. Use Arabic numerals for figures and Roman numerals for tables. Figure 1. Beispiel example of a figure caption. (figure caption) ACKNOWLEDGMENT (HEADING 5) The preferred spelling of the word \"acknowledgment\" in America is without an \"e\" after the \"g\". Vermeiden Sie die stilted expression, \"One of us (R. B. G.) thanks .  \" Versuchen Sie stattdessen \"R. B. G. thanks\". Put sponsor acknowledgments in the nonnumbered footnote on the first page. Voici est un exemple de reconnaissance. Les auteurs remercient T. Edison, G. Westinghouse, N. Tesla, A. Volta and A. Ampere for their contributions to the electric power industry. RÉFÉRENCES Les références sont importantes pour le lecteur; chaque citation doit donc être complète et correcte. unless caught by a reviewer and will detract from the authority and value of the paper. Les références devraient être facilement accessibles dans les publications. List List only one reference per reference number. Si a reference is available from two sources, each should be listed as a separate reference. number citations consecutively within brackets [1]. La punctuation de phrase follows the bracket [2]. Heading Table Column Heading Table Column Heading Table column subheading Subheading Subheading Subheading copy More table copya Multiple references [3], [4] are each numbered with separate brackets [4]-[6]. Refer to the reference number, as in [7]—do not use \"Ref. not_duplicate  \" Unless there are six authors or more give all authors' names; do not use \"et al.\" , even if they have been submitted for publication, should be cited as \"unpublished\" [8]-[10]. Capitalize only the first word in a paper title, except for proper nouns and element symbols. Für papers published in translation journals, please give the English citation first, followed by the original foreign-language citation [11]. Papers that have been accepted for publication, but not yet published, should be cited as \"in press\" [12].
